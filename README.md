# Shishir 2020

## Development
 The app makes use of the following technologies:
 
 * Kotlin over traditional Java in Android Development
 * App makes use of the new and improved `AndroidX` libraries in place of the `Support Libraries`
 * Firestore (as the No-SQL database)
 * LiveData, ViewModel
 * Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
 * Material Components (for implementing the new material design)
 * Koin (for Dependency Injection)
 * Lottie (for displaying animations in intro slider)
 * Shape of View (to modify view shapes)
 * Toast Splitties (Kotlin Extension)
 * Timber (extensible to provide utility over Android's Log class)
 * Coil (for image loading)
 * Moshi (as a new modern JSON library for Kotlin)
 * Intuit SDP (as a different size unit)

And a couple more!
